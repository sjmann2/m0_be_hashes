# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
- **I really struggled with putting all of the concepts I have learned so far together. I had a tough time understanding how iterations work on hashes and how to navigate writing code to print out keys and values in a sentence.**
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
- **Note taking is good, I am finding it really helpful to look back on notes from yesterday or the day before to remember key concepts. I take the most helpful notes when I am first learning a concept on my own rather than if I were to take notes during a live class.**
- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
- **I usually spend some time trying to solve a problem in code on my own and if I feel stuck I will turn to google. A lot of the time finding an answer on google takes a lot of parsing through more complex code that I don't understand so I prefer to see if I can figure it out on my own first.**
